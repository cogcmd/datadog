  Do you want to generate DataDog graphs from chat? Well here ya go. This
  bundle only focuses on posting graphs generated from snapshot queries. You
  can lookup metrics and then graph them and nothing more. You'll need an API
  key and Application key to authenticate with DataDog[1]. And, you'll also need
  to be familiar with the graph query syntax for generating graphs[2].

    long_description: |
      Graph metrics over a period of time. Snapshot queries are formed using an
      aggregation, metric and scope. For instance, for the query
      "avg:system.load.1{*}", "avg" is the aggregation, "system.load.1" is the
      metric and "{*}" is the scope. You can search for specific metrics with
      the `metric search` command. And, you can read more about the query
      syntax in DataDog's documentation: https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/204820019-Graphing-with-Datadog-from-the-query-to-the-graph

      By default, the start time is one hour ago and the end time is now.
      However, you can optionall specify your own start and end times. Start
      times may be specified as negative shorthand amounts relative to now or
      unix timestamps. For instance, "-1h" means the start time will be 1 hour
      ago. End times can specificed as positive shorthand amounts relative to
      the start time, unix timestamps, or the string "now". For instance, "30m"
      means the end time will be 30 minutes after the start time.

      The following time units are accepted in shorthand times:
        * d - day
        * h - hour
        * m - minute
        * s - second
    examples: |
      Graph load average for the last hour across all hosts:
      graph avg:system.load.1{*}

      Graph load average for the same time range yesterday:
      graph "-1d" avg:system.load.1{*}

      Graph load average over 10 minutes 2 hours ago:
      graph "-2h" "10m" avg:system.load.1{*}

      Graph load average over the last 24 hours:
      graph "-1d" now avg:system.load.1{*}

      Graph load average for a specific time range:
      graph 1487612717 1487781855 avg:system.load.1{*}
